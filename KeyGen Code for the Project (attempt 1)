>>>import os
>>>f=open("keyfile.txt", "wb")
>>>f.write(os.urandom(32))
f.close()




This will generate a 32 byte/character key in a text file. The text file will open as ASCII symbols, including spaces and non-printables.
We need to find a way to convert those ASCII symbols into HEX on that keyfile.txt so we can XOR our plaintext message for a cipher.
